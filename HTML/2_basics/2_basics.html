    <p title="Vicki, product designer, hiatus, book">
        Hello everyone! I’m Vicki. I’ve been a product designer at companies like Spotify, Headspace, Lyft,
        and Google. Currently, I’m taking a hiatus from product design to work on a long-time personal
        project: an illustrated book to help people make better decisions. It’s framed around all the big
        and little questions we ask and find ourselves answering throughout our lives, from deciding where
        to live, where to work, and what is our greater purpose, but also the everyday stuff like what’s
        for din, and how can I be more present or feel less anxious.
